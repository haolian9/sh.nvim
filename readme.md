a shell for nvim kernel

## status: far from usable

## design, ideas
* shell like experience
* lua REPL with state
* recognize specific EX commands, but no scripting, no state
* able to overwrite specific EX commands
* ~~run cli command, but no scripting, no state~~
* take over nvim command-line
* make use of lsp if possible
* make use of treesitter if possible
